  <h1>对牛弹琴（Duì niú tán qín）</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>On a lush meadow,the sun shines warmly. A refined man in an ancient costume sits on a large rock with a quaint lyre across his lap.</li>
    <li>His eyes were slightly closed,his expression focused,his slender fingers gently fiddling with the strings. The melodious sound of the piano slowly flowing in the air,such as crying,sometimes passionate surging,sometimes tactfully low back.</li>
    <li>Not far away,a few sturdy cattle are leisurely grazing. They occasionally flick their tails and make "moo" calls,unresponsive to the beautiful sound of the piano. Some cows only occasionally raise their heads,take a look at the man playing the piano,and then lower their heads to continue eating the grass.</li>
    <li>The man was immersed in his own music world and did not notice the cow's indifference. His face was full of intoxication,as if he were talking to heaven and earth. And those cows,still walking freely on the grass,eating grass,and the wonderful sound of the piano formed a sharp contrast.</li>
    <li>The breeze gently brushed,the grass swayed,and the sound of the piano drifted away on the empty grass,leaving a poetic but slightly helpless picture.</li>
  </ul>
